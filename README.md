# MammoYolo11
Given the widespread use and accessibility of YOLOv11 in object detection tasks, I plan to utilize this model to train on mammographic images for the detection of potential breast lesions. In addition to the INBreast dataset (comprising 109 images in the Training folder), I will also incorporate images from the Atlas of Mammography, 3rd Edition, which serve as reference images with established gold standards.
